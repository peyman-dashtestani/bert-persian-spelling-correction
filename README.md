BERT-Based Persian Spelling Correction
Project Overview
This project implements a BERT-based spelling correction system for Persian text. It utilizes the DAL-BERT model, which is specifically trained for Persian language tasks, to detect and correct spelling errors in informal Persian text.

Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bert-persian-spelling-correction.git
cd bert-persian-spelling-correction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the spelling correction system, run the following command:
bash
python correct_spelling.py --input_file input.txt --output_file corrected.txt
Data Preprocessing
The project uses a custom dataset of informal Persian words. The data preprocessing steps include:
Cleaning text by removing special characters and normalizing whitespace
Filtering out non-Persian characters
Tokenization using the DAL-BERT tokenizer
Model Architecture
The spelling correction system is based on the DAL-BERT model, which is a BERT variant trained specifically for Persian language tasks. The architecture includes:
DAL-BERT base model
Custom layers for token classification
Masked Language Model (MLM) head for predicting correct spellings
Training
The model is fine-tuned on the preprocessed dataset using the following hyperparameters:
Batch size: 32
Learning rate: 2e-5
Epochs: 5
Optimizer: AdamW
Evaluation
The system's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
